Have you ever felt like:

-   Sitting in front of your computer, clicking around, doing nothing productive, and suddenly it's lunch time.
-   Feeling busy all day but not accomplishing much.
-   Struggling to recall what you did this week when writing your weekly report.
-   Feeling anxious about job security and uncertain about finding new opportunities.

In my long career, I've spent too much time on repetitive work, wanting to improve myself but never finding the time.

This realization drove me to make a change, leading to the development of Fates, a tool to help everyone plan their time more efficiently.
